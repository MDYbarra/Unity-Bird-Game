- Add at least 2 physics constructs  (beyond what the Asgn 2 did); one the constructs must implement collisions.


New Features:
	- Game begins at night. Some targets have lights to indentify them. A ring is placed in the center
	with a billboard telling you to fly through. Once you fly through the ring it will disappear as well as the billboard and target lights. Then the night loghts wiil turn off and day lights will turn on. 
	Walls are now bouncy when you collide into them and a bouncy sound will play everytime you hit a 
	wall or ceiling but not the floor. Some of the trees are bouncy as well but will play no sound 
	when hit.


Light Sources(2):
	- Ring has area light making the inside glow golden. 
	- Nightlight directional light added with blue tints
	- Some targets have a light only during night time mode.
	- Billboard has Light.

Sounds:
	- Ring plays sound when you fly through it.
	- Walls and ceiling play sound when hit

Billboard:
	- with instructs to turn on the lights.

Physics:
	- Added bouncy physics play area bounds. Walls, ceiling and floor.
	- Added bouncy physics to some trees.
